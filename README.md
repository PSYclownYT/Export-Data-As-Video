# Export-Data-As-Video
Export ANY file as a video (you can't re encode these so be warned)

## Requirements:
FFMPEG
```cmd
 winget install ffmpeg
```
To use, you must have a file. the output will go to
```
C:/User/Downloads/videooutput.avi
```
## SETUP:

- [Download the file](https://github.com/PSYclownYT/Export-Data-As-Video/releases/download/v1/Output-Data-As-Video.ps1) (obviously)
- in powershell run
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
The reasoning for this is because I am not paying for a signature.
